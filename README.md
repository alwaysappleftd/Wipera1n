# Wipera1n
This is a tool that I coded to help people when they want to erase a checkm8-compatible device without losing the iOS version. I am pretty certain that the tool doesn't work on the iPhone 5s or iPhone 6. I will definitly update this repository if I find a way to wipe those devices though. iPhone 6s to iPhone X should work seamlessly though. This tool doesnt require any special dependencies. All you need to do is enter DFU mode on your iDevice and the tool will work. Hope you find Wipera1n useful!


HOW TO USE WIPERA1N:
1. Connect your iDevice in normal mode. If there is a passcode, then you can enter DFU mode, click Erase, and then click the pop-up that asks if your device is in DFU mode already. Enter your iOS version with the steps listed in the text field, and Wipera1n will erase your device.
2. If you have not followed the steps above, and your device is in Normal mode, then first, click the Erase Device button. Once Wipera1n detects your iOS version, it will prompt you to nter DFU mode now. You can find out how to enter DFU mode on your device by Googling "How to enter DFU mode on" and then your iPhone model. Example might be "How to enter DFU mode on iPhone 7".
3. Once in DFU mode, click the OK button and the erase will start.

6. If the device you are using is passcode locked or disabled, you may not know the iOS version of it. In this case, you can just put "12" in the version input text box. If you don't know your iOS version, Wipera1n will always ask you to put just the first part of the version, not with all of the other in-between versions. So if your device was running iOS 13.4.1, you would put just 13 in the box. This is due to a bug in the code that I cannot seem to fix at this point. If I fix it, I will remove that requirement in Wipera1n.
